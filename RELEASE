2.0

## Changes since 1.24

* Docker images using Bookworm-slim
* Use of latest Typescript version (5.3.x)
* Binaries built with Emacs instead of Commonjs: Emacs can consume Commonjs modules,
  but Commonjs can't consume Emacs modules. It means we can use more contrib modules
* src folder has been organised a bit better.
* Removed drupal 8 and drupal 9 templates.
* The way to assign IPs have changed.
* All the packages used are up to date.
